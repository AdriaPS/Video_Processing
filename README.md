# Video Processing
This is a project using Python and OpenCV to add annotations on a video.

I created this project by following Rob Mulla's tutorial to implement basic video processing on a video of a car traveling down the street. The project was undertaken for learning purposes to gain a better understanding of Python's OpenCV library. You can find the resources used and the result in the 'media' folder.

### Disclaimer
The .csv used on this project could not be uploaded into the Github because it's too large, if you want to check the .csv used, you can go to the Rob Mulla's video or the Kaggle page he used.
