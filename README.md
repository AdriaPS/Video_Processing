# Video Processing
This is a project using Python and OpenCV to add annotations on a video.

I created this project by following Rob Mulla's tutorial to implement basic video processing on a video of a car traveling down the street. The project was undertaken for learning purposes to gain a better understanding of Python's OpenCV library. You can find the resources used and the result in the 'media' folder.
